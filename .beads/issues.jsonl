{"id":"moonspec-1e8","title":"Refactor execution pipeline: parse-once discovery with in-memory feature cache","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current execution pipeline parses feature files multiple times:\n\n1. **Codegen phase** (`codegen.mbt:151`): Parses each `.feature` file to extract structure for test generation\n2. **Runtime phase** (`feature.mbt:7,13`): Re-parses the same content during test execution:\n   - `FeatureSource::Text(str)` → parses embedded string again\n   - `FeatureSource::File(path)` → re-reads from disk and parses again\n3. **PerScenario codegen mode** (`codegen.mbt:292-314`): Embeds the entire feature file content as a multiline string literal in EACH generated test — so a feature with 10 scenarios has the full feature text duplicated 10 times in the generated code\n4. **Parallel execution** (`parallel.mbt`): Each parallel async task independently parses its input with no shared cache\n\n## Research: How Cucumber Frameworks Handle This\n\nAll major cucumber frameworks (cucumber-js, behave, cucumber-rs) follow the same pattern:\n\n```\nDiscovery → Parse Once → [In-Memory Representation] → Filter → Execute → Report\n```\n\n### Key principles:\n- **Parse once, execute from memory**: Feature files are parsed exactly once during an upfront discovery phase. The parsed representation is the sole input to execution.\n- **Separation of parsing from execution**: Parsing produces an intermediate representation (Pickles in cucumber-js, Feature model objects in behave, Feature structs in cucumber-rs). The executor never touches raw Gherkin text.\n- **Example expansion before execution**: Scenario Outlines are expanded into concrete scenarios before execution begins.\n- **Step matching at execution time**: Step definitions are resolved during execution, not during parsing.\n\n### Framework-specific approaches:\n- **cucumber-js**: `loadSources()` discovers + parses all features → Pickle Compiler flattens into execution-ready Pickles → Runtime iterates Pickles\n- **behave**: `collect_feature_locations()` discovers → `parse_features()` groups by filename and parses each unique file once → `self.features` list is iterated by `run_model()`\n- **cucumber-rs**: `Basic` parser globs for features → `gherkin::Feature::parse_path()` + `.expand_examples()` → async Stream consumed once by Runner\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nRefactor the moonspec execution pipeline to follow the standard cucumber architecture:\n\n### Phase 1: Discovery\n- Add a `discover_features(paths: Array[String]) -\u003e Array[String]` function that walks directories and collects `.feature` file paths\n- Support glob patterns for flexible discovery\n\n### Phase 2: Parse Once + Cache\n- Add a `FeatureCache` type (essentially `Map[String, @gherkin.Feature]` keyed by file path)\n- Parse each discovered feature file exactly once into the cache\n- Expand Scenario Outlines at parse time (already partially done in `scenario_outline.mbt`)\n\n### Phase 3: Execution from Cache\n- Modify the runner to accept `FeatureCache` (or `Array[@gherkin.Feature]`) instead of `Array[FeatureSource]`\n- Remove `FeatureSource::Text` and `FeatureSource::File` variants (or deprecate them)\n- Default to `FeatureSource::Parsed` path which skips re-parsing\n- Parallel execution shares the same parsed cache (read-only)\n\n### Phase 4: Codegen Alignment\n- Codegen should emit `FeatureSource::Parsed(...)` or reference the cache\n- Stop embedding full feature text as string literals in generated test files\n- Instead, generate code that references the pre-parsed feature from the cache\n\n## Files Affected\n- `moonspec/src/runner/feature.mbt` — `resolve_feature()` and `execute_feature_filtered()`\n- `moonspec/src/runner/run.mbt` — Entry points `run`, `run_with_hooks`\n- `moonspec/src/runner/parallel.mbt` — Parallel execution\n- `moonspec/src/runner/results.mbt` — `FeatureSource` enum definition\n- `moonspec/src/codegen/codegen.mbt` — Test file generation\n- `moonspec/src/cmd/main/main.mbt` — CLI commands (discovery integration)\n- New file: `moonspec/src/runner/cache.mbt` or `moonspec/src/runner/discovery.mbt`\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [ ] Feature files are parsed exactly once per test run\n- [ ] In-memory cache/collection holds parsed Features for the duration of execution\n- [ ] Parallel execution shares parsed features (no re-parsing per task)\n- [ ] Generated test files no longer embed full feature content as strings\n- [ ] Existing tests continue to pass\n- [ ] `FeatureSource::Parsed` is the primary execution path","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","owner":"957246+DamianReeves@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-22T09:14:31Z","created_by":"Damian Reeves","updated_at":"2026-02-22T09:14:31Z","labels":["refactor","runner"]}
